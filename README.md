# SciExplorer
An information retrieval system that automatically transcends the problem of keyword matching by looking at how words are used in context.

In NLP jargon: A document similarity engine based on distributed text representation.

## Motivation
Interdisciplinary research is a high-risk, high-reward subset of scientific endeavor. Knowledge required to tackle truly complex problems is often siloed in disciplines that pose a two-fold problem to the curious outsider:  

1) Domain-specific jargon makes keyword search difficult, even though ideas and approaches may be alike. 
2) Only about 30% of papers cite work outside of their own discipline, and this proportion is shrinking in the sciences. [1]

Given the sheer volume of scientific output, a trend toward hyper-specialization is understandable. Yet, the opportunity in cross-pollination increases in tandem with the volumen of output. Our information retrieval systems should help us connect the dots.
